				<p><img src="assets/images/me.jpg" height="15%" width="15%">Currently, I am a student of the University of Utah.  I hope to obtain a web developer job in the near future.  I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and raised in Park City, Utah.  For a short period, I lived in Eagle, Idaho, but relocated back to Park City is just too awesome.  I'm a person of few words.  I take a serious and reserved approach to life.  But once I've warmed up to a situation I can be more outgoing.  My passion right now is astrology.  I love being able to interpret people's birth horoscopes to understand their psyche.  Like coding, I also find drawing and music production quite interesting and want to build my skills in those areas.  My main goal in life is to be a really creative person.</p>
